## [Unreleased]

- **Backwards-incompatible change:** outputs for multiple resource now return lists instead of maps, so that the same order of the input variable is kept.
- Added new outputs to expose the base resources.
- Refactored the `iam_emails` output to use the new `for` expression, fixing   issues with `formatlist` and `zipmap` in Terraform 0.12.
- Refactored and simplified the `keys` template and output using the new splat syntax.
